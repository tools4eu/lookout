**Automated OSINT & Threat Intelligence for domains, IPs, hashes, and URLs.**

Lookout is a command-line tool that lets you investigate suspicious indicators with a single command. It queries multiple threat intelligence sources in parallel and gives you a clear risk assessment — no need to manually check each service one by one.

Built for investigators and analysts who need fast, reliable results without deep technical expertise.

## What does it do?

You give Lookout a domain, IP address, file hash, or URL. Lookout automatically:

1. **Detects** what type of indicator it is
2. **Queries** up to 9 threat intelligence sources in parallel
3. **Scores** the risk based on weighted results from all sources
4. **Reports** the findings in a clear overview (table, JSON, or Markdown)

### Example

```
$ lookout investigate suspicious-domain.com

Detected type: domain

DOMAIN: suspicious-domain.com [MEDIUM (42)]

Source      Status      Risk            Details
virustotal  OK          medium (38)     8/93 malicious, 5 suspicious
urlscan     OK          clean (0)       IP: 203.0.113.50
rdap        OK          -               Registrar: Example Registrar Inc.
crtsh       OK          -               12 subdomains
threatfox   OK          clean (0)       -

Queried 5 sources in 2.34s (0 cached)
```

## Supported Indicator Types

| Type | Example | Sources used |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Domain | `example.com` | VirusTotal, URLScan, RDAP, crt.sh, ThreatFox |

## Risk Scoring

Lookout calculates a risk score from 0 to 100 based on weighted results:

| Score | Level | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 0-9 | **CLEAN** | No threats detected |
| 10-29 | **LOW** | Minor flags, probably safe |
| 30-59 | **MEDIUM** | Suspicious activity detected |
| 60-84 | **HIGH** | Multiple sources flag this as malicious |
| 85-100 | **CRITICAL** | Strong consensus: this is malicious |

## Quick Start

See the [Installation & Usage Guide (HOWTO.md)](HOWTO.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tools4eu/lookout.git
cd Lookout

# 2. Install
pip install -e .

# 3. Configure API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys (see HOWTO.md for where to get them)

# 4. Run your first investigation
lookout investigate example.com
```

## Typical Investigation Workflow

Lookout is designed to guide you through an investigation step by step. After each command, it suggests logical next steps.

```bash
# Step 1: Create a case to keep everything organized
lookout new "phishing-example-com" -d "Suspicious domain from spam report"

# Step 2: Move into the case directory
cd phishing-example-com

# Step 3: Investigate the domain (passive — target cannot see you)
lookout investigate suspicious-domain.com

# Step 4: Lookout shows results + suggests next steps:
#   → enumerate to find subdomains
#   → dirscan to look for exposed panels
#   → investigate a pivot IP or subdomain

# Step 5: Find subdomains (semi-passive)
lookout enumerate suspicious-domain.com

# Step 6: Scan for phishing panel paths (active — use proxy if needed)
lookout dirscan suspicious-domain.com --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:9050

# Step 7: Pivot — investigate the hosting IP found in step 3
lookout investigate 203.0.113.50

# Step 8: Generate final report
lookout investigate suspicious-domain.com --format docx --output reports/report.docx
```

When you run commands inside a case directory (created with `lookout new`), results are automatically saved and the case file is updated.

## Output Formats

```bash
# Table (default) - human-readable overview in the terminal
lookout investigate example.com

# JSON - for further processing or scripting
lookout investigate example.com --format json --output report.json

# Markdown - for documentation and sharing
lookout investigate example.com --format markdown --output report.md

# Word (.docx) - professional report for case files
lookout investigate example.com --format docx --output report.docx
```

| Format | Best for |
|--------|----------|
| **Table** | Quick look in the terminal |
| **JSON** | Scripting, data processing, archiving |
| **Markdown** | Notes, wikis, text-based reports |
| **Word (.docx)** | Formal reports, case files, sharing with non-technical readers |

## OPSEC — Know What Each Command Does

**Read this before using Lookout.** Not all commands are equally safe to run. Some are fully passive (invisible to the target), others are not.

### Passive commands (target CANNOT see you)

| Command | What happens | Your IP visible to target? |
|---------|-------------|---------------------------|
| `lookout investigate` | Queries third-party APIs (VirusTotal, Shodan, etc.) | **No** — traffic goes to API providers, never to the target |
| `lookout detect` | Local detection only, no network traffic | **No** |

### Semi-passive commands (low risk)

| Command | What happens | Your IP visible to target? |
|---------|-------------|---------------------------|
| `lookout enumerate` | Sends DNS queries via your DNS resolver | **Indirect** — the target's nameserver sees your DNS resolver's IP, not yours directly |

### Active commands (target CAN see you)

| Command | What happens | Your IP visible to target? |
|---------|-------------|---------------------------|
| `lookout dirscan` | Makes direct HTTP requests to the target | **YES** — your IP is in their server logs, WAF alerts, and anti-bot systems |

**To protect yourself when using `dirscan`:**
```bash
# Route through a SOCKS5 proxy (e.g. Tor)
lookout dirscan target.com --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:9050

# Route through an HTTP proxy
lookout dirscan target.com --proxy http://your-proxy:8080
```

Both `enumerate` and `dirscan` will show an OPSEC warning and ask for confirmation before proceeding. Use `--yes` to skip the warning only if you understand the risks.

See the [HOWTO](HOWTO.md#11-opsec--privacy) for more details.
